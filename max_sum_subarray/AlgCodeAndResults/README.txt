Each of our four algorithms are in a separate .cpp file and a common header file between them. 
main.cpp contains the code to our driver program.
MSS_Problems.txt is the text file given to us by the professor for input.
MSS_Results.txt is the text file generated after running our code.   Note that if you run it more than once, it will append the results to MSS_Results.txt.
